Regular expressions are constrained to maintain a finite state by definition.
Since recognizing the specified language would require to count symbols, we need at least a stack, which means infinite state.
The specified language could be defined with this grammar:

A ↦ ε
A ↦ aAb

But this is not a regular expression, since it is not a type-3 grammar, but type-2.
