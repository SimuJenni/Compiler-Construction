# Assignment 2

## Lexical Analysis

Solutions for every exercise are in their respective subfolder.

### Exercise 1

To generate the automata, the Dot language of the `graphviz` package was used.
The `dot` command can be used to generate renderings, e.g. `dot -Tsvg a\*\(bc\|d\)\*.dot > a\*\(bc\|d\)\*.svg`.

#### 1.

See `01/01`.
Trivial automata were skipped, the final solution is in `a*(bc|d)*.pdf`.

#### 2.

See `01/02`.
The final solution is in `a*(bc|d)*.pdf`.
The application of the formal conversion algorithm presented in the lecture is in `conversion.txt`.
An equivalent minified automaton is also provided.

### Exercise 2

See `02/solution.txt` and `02/Proof.jpg`.

### Exercise 3

See `03/solution.txt`.

### Exercise 4

See `04/solution.txt`.
